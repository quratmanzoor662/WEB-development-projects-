            Hi, I'm <b>QURAT-UL MANZOOR</b> , an engineering student from
            Islamic University Of Science and Technology. I'm excited to dive
            deeper into the world of engineering. I love learning new things and
            applying them to real-world situations. My goal is to use my
            engineering skills to make a positive impact on the world around me.
            Outside of my studies, you can find me tinkering with projects,
            exploring the outdoors, or spending time with friends and family.
            I'm excited to see where this journey takes me! I hope to continue
            learning and growing, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and
            inspiring others along the way.
          </p>
